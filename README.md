QA Interview assignment project for {Candidate}


## Weather 'application' overview

You are assigned to a team which is developing weather related application's **MVP** backend.
Your task is to create automated tests for the **API that the application will use**.

The MVP app will use one API, that tells the weather conditions for a fixed city. (Condition, description, temperatures ...etc.).

The API will return the following fields: `city`, `condition`, `icon`, `description` `conditionId` `tempInFahrenheit` and `tempInCelsius`


## Weather backend's acceptance criteria-s

* The **city field** would give a fixed city name as a string
* The **conditionID field** gives an ID of the current condition

  | ID   | Value   |
  | ---- | ------  |
  | 1    | clear   |
  | 2    | windy   |
  | 3    | mist    |
  | 4    | drizzle |
  | 5    | dust    |

* The **condition field** would tell the weather condition as a string based on condition id
    * Can have the following values `clear`, `windy`, `mist`, `drizzle` and `dust`
* The **icon field** gives a `png` type image (string) that correlates (same as) the current condition
* The **weather object** contains the temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius
    * The **tempInFahrenheit field** contains the current temperature in Fahrenheits
        * Should have 0 digits
    * The **tempInCelsius field** contains the current temperature in Celsius
        * Should have 0 digits
        * Calculated from the tempInFahrenheit field
        * Uses normal rounding rules
* The **description field** returns a description text of the current weather
    * The description is a fixed text with a suffix
    * The description suffix is calculated based on the temperature in celsius
    * Calculation rules:

| Rule            | Description   |
| -------------   | ------------- |
| celsius <= 0    | freezing      |
| celsius < 10    | cold          |
| celsius < 20    | mild          |
| celsius < 25    | warm          |
| celsius >= 25   | hot           |


### The API:

The base url of the API is: `base_url`
<br >**Eg.:** GET `base_url/weather`

**GET .../weather**
* You can fetch the endpoint through  `{base_url}/weather` with the following data structure:
```curl
curl -X 'GET' \
  '{base_url}/weather' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
```json
{
  "city"        : "Vienna",
  "condition"   : "clear",
  "icon"        : "clear.PNG",
  "conditionId" : 1,
  "description" : "The weather is mild",
  "weather": {
    "tempInFahrenheit" : 60,
    "tempInCelsius"    : 15
  }
}
```

### Helper API-s

You are also provided 2 helper API-s to be able to set the states for the GET weather API

Helper API-s don't need to be tested, they exist so you can set the states of the API under test

#### PUT .../weather/temp

You can set the Fahrenheit temperature with this API, by sending an Integer
* You can call the endpoint through  `{base_url}/weather/temp`
```cURL
curl -X 'PUT' \
  '{base_url}/weather/temp' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "tempInFahrenheit": 17
}'
```
#### PUT .../weather/condition

You can set the Condition ID with this API, by sending an Integer
* You can call the endpoint through  `{base_url}/weather/condition`
```cURL
curl -X 'PUT' \
  '{base_url}/weather/condition' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "condition": 1
}'
```


## Your task
You need to create a test automation framework and implement test cases for the weather API (defined above)
using **Cucumber,** **testng** and **Selenium** where needed
* Define Cucumber scenarios
    * In designing your cucumber scenarios, keep in mind that it should be understandable for someone without a technical expertise ( Eg.: Business representatives). Design them as you would have to demo it to business stakeholders
* Use the following language, frameworks and technologies within the automation project:
    * Java
    * Selenium
    * Maven and POM
    * BDD and Executed cucumber tests.
    * Add an external reporting framework of your choice. (eg.: Extent, Allure ...etc)
    * You can add any other helper library if you wish
* Create a README file with some informative description of your project
    * Also include the results of the test report of your scenarios (in the readme)
* Open a pull request to this project.

## Bonus

To also make use of selenium, test a few fields from `https://openweathermap.org/`

#### Task1
Verify the main page's search field contains correct placeholder text

![Search](./resources/openweather_search_placeholder_autumn.png)

#### Task2
* Search for `Sydney`, and select `Sydney, AU` from the list
* Verify the selected city's title is correct
* Verify that the date shown is correct
* Verify that the time shown is correct


![City](./resources/openweather_search_city.png)

Our QA and Development team will review your task carefully and contact you as soon as possible.
